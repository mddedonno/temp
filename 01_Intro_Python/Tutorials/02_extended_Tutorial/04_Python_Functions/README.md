## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Functions are an essential part of the Python programming language. A **function is a block of code defined with a name**. We use functions whenever we need to perform the same task multiple times without writing the same code again. It can take arguments and returns the value.

Python has a DRY principle like other programming languages. DRY stands for Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself. Consider a scenario where we need to do some action/task many times. We can define that action only once using a function and call that function whenever required to do the same activity.

Function improves efficiency and reduces errors because of the reusability of a code. Once we create a function, we can call it anywhere and anytime. The benefit of using a function is reusability and modularity.
