### 1. What is Pandas DateTime Module?
Working with dates and times is one of the biggest challenges in programming. Between dealing with time zones, daylight saving time, and different written date formats, it can be tough to keep track of which days and times youâ€™re referencing. Fortunately, the built-in Python datetime module can help you manage the complex nature of dates and times.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn:

* Why programming with dates and times is such a challenge
* Which functions are available in the Python datetime module
* How to print or read a date and time in a specific format
* How to do arithmetic with dates and times

### 2. What is Pandas Time Module?
The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.

This article will walk you through the most commonly used functions and objects in time.

By the end of this article, youâ€™ll be able to:

* Understand core concepts at the heart of working with dates and times, such as epochs, time zones, and daylight savings time
* Represent time in code using floats, tuples, and struct_time
* Convert between different time representations
* Suspend thread execution
* Measure code performance using perf_counter()
